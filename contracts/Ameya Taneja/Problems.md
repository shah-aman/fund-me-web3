Problems I faced
================

Personally I found the syntax of solidity very difficult, I had to read a lot of resources to make this contract

Insufficiant balance of Sepolia testnet eth, to check if my code worked

Depriciated assets of hardhat and truffle therefore debugging and testing was hard
